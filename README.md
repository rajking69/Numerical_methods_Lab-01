1. Write a program to count the number of significant digits in a given number.
2. Write a program to round off a number with n significant figures using banker's rule.
3. Write a program to evaluate a polynomial f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x + 10 by using Horner's rule at x =
4. Write a program to find the root of the equation x^3 - 9x + 1 = 0, correct to three decimal places,
   using the bisection method.
5. Write a program to find all the roots of the equation x^3 - 6x + 4 = 0, correct to three decimal
   places. [Use the bisection method].
6. Write a program to find the root of the equation x^3 - 6x + 4 = 0, correct to three decimal places,
   using the Newton-Raphson method.
7. Write a program to find the root of the equation x^3 - x + 2 = 0, correct to three decimal places,
   using the false position method.
8. Write a program to find the root of the equation x^3 - 5x^2 - 29 = 0, correct to three decimal
   places, using the secant method.
9. Write a program to find the quotient polynomial q(x) such that p(x) = (x - 2) q(x) where the
   polynomial p(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 8 = 0 has a root at x = 2.
10. Write a program to find all the roots of the equation x^3 - 6x + 4 = 0, correct to three decimal
    places. [Use the Newton-Raphson method with deflation].
